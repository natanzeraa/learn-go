### Enhancing Your Experience with **Better Comments** üé®
To improve the readability of comments and make them more informative, I‚Äôve used **Better Comments** styling throughout the code. This helps highlight important details, warnings, best practices, and references more effectively.

#### **Installing Better Comments** in VS Code:
1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Go to the **Extensions Marketplace**.
3. Search for `Better Comments` by **Aaron Bond**.
4. Click **Install**.

Once installed, comments in the code will appear color-coded and visually enhanced, making it easier to focus on specific details.

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/natanzeraa/learn-go.git
   cd learn-go
   ```
3. Open the folder in **VS Code**.
4. Run any of the `.go` files using:
   ```bash
   go run folder/filename.go
   ```
